# Text to Speech Web App

## Overview

The **Text to Speech Web App** is a powerful and user-friendly application designed to convert text into natural-sounding speech. This web-based tool utilizes cutting-edge technologies, including the GTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library, to provide an efficient and seamless text-to-speech conversion experience.

### Key Features

- **Speech Generation**: Instantly convert typed or pasted text into high-quality speech output.
- **GTTS Integration**: Leverages the GTTS library to harness the power of Google's advanced text-to-speech engine.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience across various devices.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Intuitive interface for straightforward text input and audio playback.

### Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Backend framework for handling web requests and serving the application.
- **GTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)**: Library for interfacing with Google Translate's text-to-speech API.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend technologies to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface.

## How it Works

1. **Text Input**: Users can enter or paste the desired text into the input area provided on the web app.
2. **Speech Generation**: Upon clicking the "Predict" button, the text is sent to the server.
3. **GTTS Conversion**: The server uses the GTTS library to convert the text into speech.
4. **Audio Playback**: The generated speech is played back to the user through an embedded audio player on the web page.
